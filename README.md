# Goods Management System

The Goods Management System is a Java-based application developed using the BlueJ integrated development environment (IDE). It allows users to manage and track various categories of goods, handle goods issuance, generate reports, and track product sales. The system incorporates data structures such as stacks, queues, and lists, as well as iterators, recursion, and HashMaps for efficient management and processing of goods and bills.

## Features

- Categorizes goods into 11 categories, including beverages, bakery items, canned/jarred goods, dairy products, and more.
- Implements data structures:
  - Stacks for adding and removing items in categories 1 to 4.
  - Queues for adding and removing items in categories 5 to 7.
  - Lists for adding and removing items in categories 8 to 11.
- Utilizes iterators for traversing goods inventory.
- Implements recursion for hierarchical bill structures.
- Manages goods issuance using stack and queue implementations.
- Tracks product sales using HashMaps and maintains a sales file.
- Allows storage of vendor information using HashMaps.
- Maintains stock balance to prevent excessive or insufficient stock levels.
- Generates reports to analyze data structure performance and view sales data.
- Implements searching and sorting algorithms for items in categories 6 to 11.
- Analyzes algorithm performance using Big O Notation.
